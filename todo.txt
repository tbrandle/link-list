To-do:

  jQuery:
  - figure out toggle class for article background color...it will change for the read-btn, but not for anything else:
        - #article: #f2f4f4
        - URL underline: #CFD8DC

  CSS:
  - The application should be responsive and work equally well on desktop and mobile. (Flexbox is your friend here.)
  - learn flexbox to make the two column layout 100% height.
